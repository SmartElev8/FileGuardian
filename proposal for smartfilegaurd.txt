1.4 PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project will begin with requirements gathering through research and user feedback to identify key features and user expectations for a malware detection system. The development process will follow an iterative approach, incorporating user input and testing at each stage.
The backend will be developed using Python and Flask, integrating machine learning models for malware detection. The frontend will utilize modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to deliver a polished and responsive user experience. File uploads will be securely handled, and results will be presented in an informative and user-friendly manner.
Regular updates and improvements will be made based on user feedback and advancements in malware detection techniques. The system will be deployed on a secure hosting environment, with ongoing maintenance to address vulnerabilities and enhance performance.

1.5 PROJECT SCOPE
The scope of FileGuardian encompasses the design, development, and deployment of an AI-powered malware detection web application. Key aspects include:
- Development of a robust backend capable of analyzing files for malware using AI/ML models.
- Implementation of a secure and intuitive web interface for file uploads and results display.
- Support for multiple file types and real-time analysis.
- Provision of educational resources and documentation for users.
- Exclusion of features such as real-time system monitoring or mobile app development, focusing instead on web-based file analysis.

1.6 PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The justification for FileGuardian is rooted in the growing need for effective, accessible malware detection solutions:
- Rising Cyber Threats: The increasing frequency and sophistication of malware attacks necessitate advanced detection tools.
- Limitations of Traditional Methods: Signature-based detection often fails to identify new or obfuscated threats, highlighting the need for AI-driven approaches.
